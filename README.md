**PyAnalySeries** is a Python application built on **matplotlib**, with a **PyQt-based graphical interface**, making it easily portable across platforms including **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.  
It is designed as a modern continuation of the <a href="https://github.com/PaleoIPSL/AnalySeries" target="_blank">**AnalySeries**</a>, the original application on MacOS, aiming to reproduce its core functionalities within a more robust and portable Python environment.  
Special attention has been given to **ergonomics**, emphasizing **simplicity** and **clarity**, while offering intuitive interactivity such as **zooming**, **panning**, and **scrolling**, with **linked or independent axis**.  
The core design follows a **"Define then Apply"** workflow for data processing operations such as **filtering**, **sampling**, and **interpolation**.  
Documents are read and saved in an **open format** spreadsheet (xlsx) with **multiple worksheets** for organization. It is also possible to import series or pointers directly from the **clipboard**, following a simple **copy (Ctrl+C)** and **paste (Ctrl+V)** operation from an external spreadsheet.  
The application leverages **robust, well-tested modules** for interpolation, notably **SciPy**, and features an **interactive interface** for defining **interpolation pointers** (formerly known as *Linage* and *Splinage*), allowing for **precise placement and manipulation**—either directly on data points or independently.  

PyAnalySeries provides access to insolation computations through the **Insolation** module, including astronomical solutions and derived quantities such as eccentricity, obliquity, precession parameters, and various insolation metrics. It also integrates the **Pyleoclim** package for time series processing, including detrending, frequency filtering, and power spectral density (PSD) estimation.

Based on: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, shapely, openpyxl, PyQt, Inso, Pyleoclim
